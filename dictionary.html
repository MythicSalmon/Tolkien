The Third King of the Ñoldor, Finarfin, repented and asked for forgiveness from the Valar, however, nine-tenths of the Ñoldor did not and proceeded to enact upon Beleriand and their vengeful quest against Melkor.

It ends with the defeat of Melkor and is argued as either being the longest or the shortest of the ages. That is because time was not yet properly calandered and so if you went with the First Age beginning at the rising of the Sun and Moon, it is the shortest, but if you begin it with the Valian Years of Melkor's rebellion, it is the longest. Either 500 years to 50,000 years in length.</p>

However, the Númenóreans were said to have worshiped Eru Ilúvatar with that of the Three Prayers held during the course of a year, and that the Meneltarma were completely divoted to him. Both the Númenóreans and the Eldar hailed Eru Ilúvatar as the True God, and worship of any other being was considered an "abomination."

<br>
<p id="manwe"><b>Manwë:</b> King of th Valar and Arda, and the brother of Melkor, he was said to be the greatest of the Ainur in authority, but not power. Often associated with the winds, the air, and the birds (which were called his servants), he was appointed by Eru Ilúvatar to be ruler, hence why he is also known as the 'Eldar King'. He was said to be the dearest to Eru Ilúvatar, the closest to him in mind, and his spouse was the Ainu Varda to whom it is said that they are "hardly parted".

It is the Void that he is banished and imprisoned within, leaving his evil deeds to the maiar who followed him in that of Sauron. According to prophecy, it is said that in the end, Melkor will return, rising in great wrath and strength, but will be destoryed for good in Dagor Dagorath.

They once were able to die at will, but lost such a gift after the Destruction of Númenor where death takes them by force.

Only kings were said to be allowed to utter reverance to Eru Ilúvatar, and only during the feasts of Erukyermë, Erulaitalë and Eruhantalë. Interesting enough, animals do not appraoch Meneltarma, only the Eagles of Manwë  were ever seen over its summit.

<p id="thevoid"><b>the Void:</b> Often a reference to an uninhabited space that exists outside and seperate from Time and Creation. It is said to be without the Flame Imperishable and that Melkor often wandered the Void in search of the Flame Imperishable that was no doubt with Eru Ilúvatar in the Timeless Halls, as the Timeless Halls are seperate from the Void and from Eä, as the Void was created amid Eä but not part of it. After the War of Wrath, Melkor was said to have been casted into the 'Timeless Void' through the Door of the Night and beyond the Walls of the World. However, it is predicted that he will return from beyond the Walls of the World and bring about the End. The void is often used as a simple reference by Elves and Men to reference the distant spaces of Eä. It is said the spirit of Sauron also entered into the Void after the destruction of the One Ring. The Void is alternatively known as: e Outer Dark, the Everlasting Dark, the Ancient Darkness.</p>

<p id="varda"><b>Varda:</b> One of the Valar, said to be the wife of Manwë. She is the Ainu of the stars and the Queen of the Valar. It is said that all of Eä rejoices in her light, and that she is unspeakably beautiful, for her face shines with the light of Ilúvatar. Melkor once desired her as a wife and attempted to court her, but she rejected him, for it is believed even before Time, she saw the darkness he possessed and instead married Manwë, to whom the two are said to often not be apart. The Elves have a special relationship with Varda, for when they first awoke, it was her stars that they saw and because of this, they call her Elbereth Gilthoniel and there are hymns created in her honor. Arwen is said to evoke her name during the Third Age to seperate the waters of a river between she and the Ringwraiths and suggests then that Varda particularly listens to the please of the Elves when they call upon her name. She is said to be the most beloved Valar and the one most commonly prayed too.</p>
<br>
<p id="west"><b>West:</b> Whenever the "West" is mentioned, it is often in reference to Aman, the Undying Lands, an ideal paradise that is away from the evil of the worlds, and therefore associated with concepts of good, and peace, or something holy.</p>
<br>
<p id="yavanna"><b>Yavanna:</b> An Aniu and one of the Valar, said to be the greatest of the Queen of the Valar besides that of Varda. She was the wife of Aulë and was said to be responsable for all things that grew of the earth. She created the Ents and in some origin stories, may have created the Hobbits as well. She is often depicted as a woman being robed in green and that Melian was once a Maiar in service to her, the mother of Lúthien and an ancestor of Arwen. She is often associated with the waters of Ulmo, and can alternatively be known as Queen of the Earth.</p>

<p id="yott"><b>Years of the Trees:</b> Said to be the long years that happened before the Darkening of Valinor. They were marked by the light of the Two Trees, the years beginning at their creation and endng at their destruction.</p>

<p><b>Ainur:</b>Primodial, divine spirits, the Ainur were the first creations of Eru Ilúvatar made before Eä and assisted in what is known as the 'Great Music'. The Ainur are also called the 'Holy Ones' and are said to be the mightiest and oldest beings besides that of Eru Ilúvatar himself. There are fifteen Ainurs more powerful than the rest, and these fifteen are sometimes known as the "Ainu" "Aratar" or the "Valar".</p>
<p><b>Aulë:</b> An Ainu, Aulë is often the Valar associated with smithing and dwarves, so much so he is known as the "Smith of the Valar" and is said to be concerned with natural substances of craft such as rock and metal. The Dwarves call him "the Maker" and he is said to be the third most powerful of the Aratar. He is also husband of the Valar, Yavanna, and resides within Valinor. Some notable achievements beyind creating the Dwarves are creating the chains Angainor that bound Malkor during his momentary imprisonment, and the lamps Illuin and Ormal, as well as the vessels of the Sun and the Moon. Sauron was formally a Maiar of Aulë, known as Mairon.</p>
<p><b>Children of Eru:</b> A reference to the races of Elves and Man, known also as "Híni Ilúvataro" or "Eruhíni". Their existance was specifically designed by Eru Ilúvatar and was concieved during the 'Great Music'. They shared the same fëar as the Ainur, but were less powerful and the Ainur had no involvement in their creation.</p> 
<p><b>Cuiviénen:</b> A bay that is located in the distant East of Middle Earth, said to be on the eastern shore of the sea of Helcar. It is where Eru Ilúvatar woke the first of the Elves, approximately 1050 in the Year of the Trees. The first of the Elves were divided into three groups: the Minyar, the Tatyar, and the Nelyar. It is said the first of the Elves remained in Cuiviénen for fifty Valian years before the first Sundering, to live with the Valar in Aman.</p>
<p><b>Dark Lord:</b> A title given to the "Great Enemy" of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth. Only two entities have possessed such a name, that being the Ainu Melkor, and the Maiar Sauron.</p> 
<p><b>Doom of Mandos:</b> Called also "The Doom of the Ñoldor" this speaks to a curse or "doom" placed upon the Ñoldor who carried out what is known as the "Kinslaying" at Alqualondë at the orders of the Second King of the Ñoldor, Fëanor. It was the Ainu Mandos that passed upon this judgement of the Valar, and was a warning that great misfortune would come upon the Ñoldor that did not repent of the killing. The Third King of the Ñoldor, Finarfin, repented and asked for forgiveness from the Valar, however, nine-tenths of the Ñoldor did not and proceeded to enact upon Beleriand and their vengeful quest against Melkor. The disasterous wars that followed fullfilled the Doom prophecy.</p>
<p><b>Dwarves:</b> Known also as the "Khazâd" in their own tongue, Dwarves are a race of inhabitants in Middle Earth created by the Ainu Oromë. They are often most noted by their short stature, and ability to craft, often being either blacksmiths or stoneworkers. They have a long mistrust of the Elves and are often agreeable with the Hobbits in nature, and are not considered to be Children of Eru. There were several clans of the Dwarves, the seven clans being: Longbeards, Firebeards, Broadbeams, Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots.</p>
<p><b>Eä:</b> The "Created World" in Quenya, it is the name given to the created universe that Eru Ilúvatar imagined and the Ainur helped create before the beginning of time during the 'Great Music'. It is distinguished apart of the Timless Halls and of the Void, for those such places have no material form. Arda is the earth within Eä, and Middle Earth is a continent within Arda.</p>
<p><b>Eldar:</b> Refernces the Elves that accepted the summons of the Ainu Oromë to Aman.</p>
<p><b>Elves:</b> Noted to be the first of the Children of Eru, Elves are the oldest species outside that of the Ainur, and thereofre are also known as the 'Firstborn'. The Elves are often distinguished from other races by their immortality, their cultivation in art and music, their often tall stature, and noted beauty. The Vanyar, the Noldor, the Teleri, the Sindar, the Nandor, the Silvan, the Falmari, and the Avari are all variations of Elves.</p>
<p><b>Ents:</b> A group of beings that reside within Arda, Ents are noted to be sentiant tree-like creatures that were created upon the request of the Ainu Yavanna. They were to protect the trees from other creatures, most notibaly the Dwarves, and were considered the 'Shepherds of the Trees' for this reason. They are said to be the most ancient creatures surviving in Middle Earth by the time of the Third Age and have long developed their own language known as "Entish".</p>
<p><b>Eru Ilúvatar:</b> The creator, Eru Ilúvatar is the Superior being that is noted to be both omiscisent and omnipotent. He dwells within the Timeless Halls and possesses the Flame Imperishable. It is said that his spirit kindles existence of nothingness, and that from his thought came music and the Ainur and all he intended to create. Eru is noted to be a transcendent being that is removed from the affairs of Arda, and was seldom worshiped, for his name was too holy to be evoked.</p> 
<p><b>Ezellohar:</b> Called also "Corollairë", it was said to be the Green Mound that was before the western gates of Valmar, the city of the Valar. It was the place where the Two Trees of Valinor grew, after the Ainu Yavanna hallowed them out and the Ainu Nienna watered them with her tears. It was at Ezellohar where the Ainur Melkor and Ungoliant came upon the Two Trees and sucked out their essance.</p>
<p><b>Fëanor:</b> The eldest son of the First King of the Ñoldor Finwë, Fëanor was said to have the greatest skill of both word and hand, and was both a renowned warrior and a craftsman. His greatest and most terrible creation were that of the Silmarils, that were later stolen by Melkor and evoked the Oath of Fëanor, that swore to return the Silmarils to him. That Oath was coupled by the Doom of Mandos that lead to the fall of Fëanor and his seven sons. Much of the tragedies of the First Age are due to the pride of Fëanor.</p>
<p><b>Fëar:</b> A Quenya word that references the spirit or the soul of creatures such as Elves or Men, though the Ainur are said to possess fëar as well. Fëar was sent into Eä by Eru Ilúvatar himself, and the word is only used to describe the natural state of the soul. It is said also to be an indestructable force that can only be dominated by consent, such as when Fëanor's mother, Míriel, gave up her fëar after his birth, thus giving up her immortality and thus dying, though was said she was later returned to life and entered into the service of the Ainu Vairë.</p>
<p><b>Finwë:</b> The First King of the Ñoldor, who lead his people to Aman following the sundering and the Great Journey. He was the father of Fëanor, and had two wives, the first being Míriel, and the second, Indis the Fair, a golden-haired Vanya. With Indis, he had two songs, Fingolfin and Finarfin, as well as two daughters, Findis and Írimë. Fëanor was his edest, and the only child he had with his first wife, Míriel. Finwë was later murdered by Melkor who sought the Silmarils that Fëanor had created. It is siad that after his death, he dwelt in the Halls of Mandos awhile, and was offered a chance at reincarnation, but gave such over to Míriel.</p>
<p><b>First Age:</b></p>
<p><b>Flame Imperishable:</b> The "Secret Fire" as it is also known, said to be the source of the creative power of Eru Ilúvatar and what is used to give forth life and substance. It is something desired grately by the Ainur Melkor who sought to make his own creations, and that without the Falme Imperishable, such creations are never whole and thus are corrupted and derived of true life.</p>
<p><b>Gift of Man:</b> References mortality and death given to Men by Eru Ilúvatar, and that it is said man is the only race with "free-will" to live outside the Music of the Ainur and to create and live the lives that they please. Death is seen as the greatest gift of all, for upon death, Men are said to go and live beside Eru Ilúvatar himself.</p>
<p><b>Helcar:</b> A great tower that is said to have held one of the Two Lamps.</p>
<p><b>Hildórien:</b> The land in the far East of Middle Earth where Men is said to have first awoke at the beginning of the First Age. It is said among the Elves, that it was at Hildórien where Melkor first put darkness into the heart of Men, and that some Men went to war with one another, while others fled towards the Light of the West.</p>
<p><b>Hobbits:</b> Another race of being found within Middle Earth, known for their stocky and short despositions, and humbled way of living. They are thought to either be related to Men or to be created by the Ainu Yavanna, and are noted to have "played a little role in history" until that of the Third Age and the War of the Ring. Hobbits are said to live in the Shire and speak a language known as Hobbitish and live a slightly-longer lifespan then that of Men that averages somewhere between 90 to 100 years of age.</p>
<p><b>Hröar:</b> Said to be the Quenya term for the "body". The Children of Eru are said to possess a hröar and a fëar (or fëa), and while it is said the spirit of the fëa is bestowed upon them by the Flame Imperishable, and it is the hröa that is made out of the materials of Arda.</p>
<p><b>Ilúvatarism:</b> The belief and worship of Eru Ilúvatar. For though Tolkien said that the Elves had no religion, and such religion and worship was left in the hands of the gods (the Ainur) and that only the Ainu Manwë made a high feast in praise to Eru Ilúvatar to celebrate the gathering of fruit. However, the Númenóreans were said to have worshiped Eru Ilúvatar with that of the Three Prayers held during the course of a year, and that the Meneltarma were completely divoted to him. Both the Númenóreans and the Eldar hailed Eru Ilúvatar as the True God, and worship of any other being was considered an "abomination." Fëanor was said to have sworn his Oath in the name of Eru Ilúvatar.</p>
<p><b>Illuin:</b> One of the Two Lamps of the Valar, filled by the Ainu Varda and hallowed about by the Ainur Manwë, in order to bring light in the Ancient Days before that of the Two Trees and the Sun and Moon that proceeded its destruction. Illuin was noted to be set in the tower Helcar in the northern part of Middle Earth.</p>
  <p><b>Laurelin:</b> Known also as the "Golden Tree of Aman" it is the younger of the Two Trees and the female mate of Telporian. Laurelin was said to have "gold-trimmed leaves" and that her dew was collected by Varda and that she flowered and bloomed during the latter part of each Valian day. It is said through the power of the Ainu Nienna and the Ainu Yavanna, Laurelin was able to produce a single, fiery fruit before she died after her essance was sucked out by Ungoliant, and that it was this fiery fruit that was set in a vessel made by the Ainu  Aulë and steered into the sky by the Maiar Arien, thus becoming the Sun.</p>
  <p><b>Manwë:</b> King of th Valar and Arda, and the brother of Melkor, he was said to be the greatest of the Ainur in authority, but not power. Often associated with the winds, the air, and the birds (which were called his servants), he was appointed by Eru Ilúvatar to be ruler, hence why he is also known as the 'Eldar King'. He was said to be the dearest to Eru Ilúvatar, the closest to him in mind, and his spouse was the Ainu Varda to whom it is said that they are "hardly parted". He lives in his halls that are said to be on the top of Mount Tainquetil, the highest mountain of the world. It is said that his servants brought knowedge to him of all the darkest and deepest places of the world, sans the seas or those who hid by the black thought of evil.</p>
<p><b>Maiar:</b> Lesser Ainur that are not counted among the Valar, spirits that often serve the Ainu and often descended into Arda to help shape the World. There are said to be numerous maiar, some named, most not, and that few took visible shape. They often swear alligance to a Valar and serve in their stead. Some maiar of note are: Eönwë, Ilmarë, Ossë, Uinen, Sauron, Gandalf, Balrogs, and Melian.</p>
<p><b>Melkor:</b> The most powerful of the Ainu, brother to Manwë, and the first to bare the title of Dark Lord, and the Great Enemy to the Free People of Middle Earth during the First Age. Known also as Morgoth, he fell from glroy when he corrupted the 'Great Music' by adding in his own discorse, and created the Orcs and perverted the Balrog. It is said he desired the Flame Imperishable, and that he often wandered the Void, where he returned twisted and different. It is the Void that he is banished and imprisoned within, leaving his evil deeds to the maiar who followed him in that of Sauron. According to prophecy, it is said that in the end, Melkor will return, rising in great wrath and strength, but will be destoryed for good in Dagor Dagorath. He is often associated with the crown of Silmarils which he stole and wore upon his head until the theft of the elf-maiden Lúthien Tinúviel and the man, Beren.</p>
<p><b>Melkorism:</b> The belief and worship of Melkor. Often less associated with actual worship, and more so the perversion of races and being lead astray from Eru Ilúvatar. The Orcs are corrupted subjects of Melkor, and that early tribes of Men in Hildórien were overcome by his Shadow. The Downfall of Númenor is the greatest example, when Sauron lead the King Ar-Pharazôn away from the Valar, and had him enact a war against Aman in the story known as The Akallabêth.</p>
<p><b>Men:</b></p>
<p><b>Meneltarma:</b> Said to be a sacred mountain in the center of Númenor. It is known as the "Holy Mountain" and was said to be a sacred place to the  Númenóreans, and was dedicated to  Eru Ilúvatar as a place of worship. There was a requierment of absolute silence to any who climbed the mountain, and it was said that the tradition was "so strong and so universal" that even strangers felt abide to obey it. Only kings were said to be allowed to utter reverance to Eru Ilúvatar, and only during the feasts of Erukyermë, Erulaitalë and Eruhantalë. Interesting enough, animals do not appraoch Meneltarma, only the Eagles of Manwë  were ever seen over its summit. It is said to be the highest peak of Númenor, and that after the destruction of Númenor, some swore that it remained - many seeking to reach it, for upon Meneltarma, it is believed one may catch a glimpse of Aman.</p>

<p><b>Sundering:</b> Speaks of a divide between the Elves and the great migration. The first sundering occured after the Eldar woke in Cuiviénen to answer the summoning of the Ainu Oromë to live with the Valar in Aman. This lead to the 'Great Journey' where the first of the Elves traveled to Aman, and lead also to the split that seperated the Elves into two groups: The Avari and the Eldar. The Avari rejected the summons of the Valar and remained in Middle Earth and many of the Avari came from the tribe of the Teleri. They came also to be known as the "Unwilling". The Eldar were the Elves that accepted the summons, and were given the name "People of the Stars" by the Ainu Oromë. There were at least three different sunderings of the Elves.</p>

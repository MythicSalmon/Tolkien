        <h1>Religions of Arda: Purpose & Fair Use</h1>
    
        <p>The Religions of Arda was an archive created for a Lindenwood University Digital Humanities project by Lindenwood university students. The goal of this archive is to provide information relating to the works of J.R.R. Tolkien and educating individuals interested in religious examples found in J.R.R. Tolkien’s work.</p>

        <p>Please note that not every religious example will be included. This is an amateur and freelance website and does not claim to be an acting authority. Most of the examples included are an individual assumption of the descriptors possessing a religious quality to a degree and may be subject to argument and personal perspective and preference and was largely gathered by the help of the J.R.R. Tolkien Tumblr community.</p>
        <p>The Lindenwood University students behind Religions of Arda are in no way associated or affiliated with Tolkien Enterprises, Tolkien Estate, Houghton Mifflin, Harper Collins UK, New Line Cinema, or the New Line film trilogy and are merely fans of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Legendarium. We do not claim to be professional scholars. </p>
        <p>The sources will mostly be from J.R.R. Tolkien’s <i>The Silmarillion, The Unfinished Tales, The Hobbit, </i>and <i>The Lord of the Rings.</i> However, online sources and articles may also be used and will be referenced if they helped or influenced in the creation of content. </p>
        <p>We will refrain from using images relating to Tolkien’s work without credit and most of the original artwork featured on some of the pages were drawn by ourselves. We will follow the same protocol as Tolkien Gateway, Middle-Earth Encyclopedia, and other online Tolkien archive and websites.</p>

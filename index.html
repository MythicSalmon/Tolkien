	<h2>Welcome!</h2><br>
	The question of religion in The Lord Of The Rings has always been perplexing. There are those who think it does not exist in the world of Middle Earth (hobbits, for instance, seem particularly irreligious). Some may think that the Elves are a revered race. However, when you jump into the world of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Silmarillion, with it’s overarching mythology, the question of religion in Middle Earth comes more to the forefront than in L.O.T.R. It’s tale of the supernatural beings who had a hand in creating Middle Earth make it possible to ascertain the role of religion in Middle Earth. It could be argued that it is monotheistic, with its references to the role of Eru Illuvatar. You might be able to make a case for polytheism (Illuvatar seems to disappear from the narrative quickly, giving way to the Valar). One might look at the Hobbits and possibly the Men of Rohan and see strains of atheism. And perhaps this is some of what draws people to Tolkien’s creation. In his desire to give to the English people a mythology of their own, Tolkien created a universe where people of any religious persuasion (or perhaps even none) find welcome. This site is but a small attempt to explore that world and some of those belief systems.

			<h1>Illúvatarism</h1><br>
			
	 		<p>“There was Eru, the One, who in Arda is called Ilúvatar; and he made first the Ainur, the Holy Ones, that were the offspring of his thought, and they were with him before aught else was made. And he spoke to them, propounding to them themes of music; and they sang before him, and he was glad. But for a long while they sang only each alone, or but few together, while the rest hearkened; for each comprehended only that part of the mind of Ilúvatar from which he came, and in the understanding of their brethren they grew but slowly. Yet ever as they listened they came to deeper understanding, and increased in unison and harmony.” <br>

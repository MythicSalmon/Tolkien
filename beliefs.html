  <h1>The Parallels to Tolkien’s Catholicism</h1>

  <br>
  <p><i>An analysis by Beth</i></p>
  <br>
  <p>It is often easy to assess an author’s personal philosophy when reading their work. Indeed, that is a likely reason for writing in the first place. A likely reason for analyzing an author’s work is to discern what they were thinking during the writing process. It may be true that we sometimes get it wrong in the process. For example, many assumed Tolkien’s work in the Lord of the Rings was an allegory for events in Europe during the first half of the 20th century. Tolkien put a quick stop to this with the statement in the introduction to The Lord of the Rings,  “I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.” That would seem to end any discussion on the matter. The author of the work has stated definitively that it is not allegory. It is therefore, not allegory. </p>
<br>
<p>So what kind of work is it? Tolkien had said his chief motivation for creating The Lord of the Rings and the world of Middle Earth was to give England it’s mythology, which he felt other cultures had but they lacked. However, what of Tolkien’s own beliefs may have sunk into his work in Middle Earth? </p>
<br>
<p>The first hint of Tolkien’s beliefs can be found in the opening chapters of The Silmarillion, which parallel the opening chapters of Genesis heavily. It establishes a monotheistic creation (“There was Eru, the One, who in Arda is called Ilúvatar; and he made first the Ainur, the Holy Ones, that were the offspring of his thought, and they were with him before aught else was made.”). The narrative also keeps pace with traditional catholic/Christian theology. God/Eru creates the world, one angel rebels and becomes Satan/Melkor. </p>
<br>
<p>Later, both men and elves come to life or “awaken” in the East and then travel into the west. This is keeping in line with the Bible’s version of creation (And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.). Here again Tolkien parallels Christianity in his own creation by saying about men and Morgoth in The Simarillion, “and this seemed to him(Morgoth) so great a matter that secretly under shadow he himself departed from Angband, and went forth into Middle-earth, leaving to Sauron the command of the War. Of his dealings with Men the Eldar indeed knew nothing, at that time, and learnt but little afterwards; but that a darkness lay upon the hearts of Men”. This mirror the account in Genesis of Satan’s attempt to corrupt men in a garden that has been planted in the “East”. It seems to have been important to Tolkien to ensure that the mythology he was creating was capable of fitting into his own existing belief structure.</p>
<br> 
<p>But as with the quote having to do with Tolkien’s views on allegory, an answer may be found in Tolkien’s own words. In a letter to his friend Robert Murray in 1953, before L.O.T.R. had been published, Tolkien stated, “I think I know exactly what you mean by the order of Grace; and of course by your references to Our Lady, upon which all my own small perception of beauty both in majesty and simplicity is founded. The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision.”. One way this could perhaps be seen in Middle Earth is the function of women in the story. IF you view Eowyn as perhaps an exception that proves the rule, the role of women, even powerful ones like Galadriel, their function seems to be nurturing and healing and revolving around the home. For instance, for all of her power, Galadriel takes no part in the battle over the ring, confining herself to Lothlorien. Another way the Lord of The Rings might be seen as a Catholic work is if you view the Valar as kind of patron saints of their various functions. For example, the Elves awoke for the first time at night, seeing stars as the first thing, they revere Varda as the maker of them. The Dwarves revered Aule as their creator. </p>
<br>
<p>Another source of Tolkien’s own words on the matter can be found in his essay “On Fairie Stories where he pontificates on the place of the Gospels in reference to mythology. “The Gospels contain a fairy-story, or a story of a larger kind which embraces all the essence of fairy-stories. They contain many marvels—peculiarly artistic, beautiful, and moving: “mythical” in their perfect, self-contained significance; and among the marvels is the greatest and most complete conceivable eucatastrophe. But this story has entered History and the primary world; the desire and aspiration of sub-creation has been raised to the fulfillment of Creation. The Birth of Christ is the eucatastrophe of Man’s history.”. Later in the same work he asserts that “God is the Lord of angels, and of men,,, and of elves.” </p>
<br>
<p>An interesting side note to Tolkien’s religious beliefs was that C.S. Lewis, who had been an avowed atheist, gave some credit for his conversion to theism and eventually Christianity, to a discussion with Tolkien in his offices at Oxford. This would be important to many Christians later, as a substantial part of Lewis’s career and writings would revolve around Christian apologetics. </p>
<br>
<p>A unique feature of Tolkien’s creation, is that it is big enough for everyone, no matter your particular beliefs. It encompasses the difficult task of making room for the spiritual, without embracing a particular dogma and is thereby open and inviting to everyone</p>

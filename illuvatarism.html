  <h1>Ilúvatarism</h1><br>
<!--Opening Paragraph-->
  <p><b>Ilúvatarism</b> is the belief and worship of <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> and the heavenly host of the 
  <a href="dictionary.html#valar"><b>Valar</b></a> created underneath him, most notably the <a href="dictionary.html#ainur"><b>Ainur</b></a>,
  and the <a href="dictionary.html#Maiar"><b>Maiar</b></a>. Attributes of Ilúvatarism may be the dedication and worship of Eru Ilúvatar, often 
  entailing respect and submission to the <a href="dictionary.html#ainur"><b>Ainur</b></a>, to which <a href="dictionary.html#ea"><b>Eä</b></a>
   is divinely dictated underneath them, or simply the belief in the existence of Eru Ilúvatar.</p>
   <br>
<!--Music Paragrpah-->
    <h2>Music</h2>
<p>Music plays a critical role in the mythos of J.R.R. Tolkien’s legendarium. “The Great Music” of the <i>Ainulindalë</i>  showcases the creative
power of music, and Song is often used as a means of battle such as with the Ballad of <a href="dictionary.html#sauron"><b>Sauron</b></a>
<a href="dictionary.html#ainur"><b>Ainur</b></a> and <b>Finrod Felagund</b>, proving that music is perhaps the most powerful force of Tolkien’s 
universe and essential in the religious aspects of <a href="dictionary.html#ea"><b>ea</b></a></p>
<br>

<!--Creation-->
<h3>Creation</h3>
<p>The creation of <a href="dictionary.html#ea"><b>ea</b></a> is accounted in the <i>Ainulindalë</i> and speaks of the “The Great Music” 
(which translates in the Elvish language of Quenya to mean “Music of the Ainur”). It is through the creative power of music that the 
entire cosmos is created, and it is said that <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> made divine music within 
the <a href="dictionary.html#ainur"><b>Ainur.</b></a></p>

<!--First Theme-->
<p><i>The First Theme: </i> References when <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> permitted the 
<a href="dictionary.html#ainur"><b>Ainur</b></a> to weave their own ideas into the Music—endowed to them by 
the <a href="dictionary.html#flameimperishable"><b>Flame Imperishable.</b></a> The Music was said to have filled the
<a href="dictionary.html#timelesshalls"><b>Timeless Halls</b></a> and passed even beyond them into <a href="dictionary.html#thevoid"><b>the Void</b></a>,
and so that “it was not the void”. The flawless Music of the <a href="dictionary.html#ainur"><b>Ainur</b></a> satisfied even
<a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a>, but discord entered the theme of music on the
account of <a href="dictionary.html#melkor"><b>Melkor</b></a>, an Ainu whose thoughts were different than that of the others, 
and had become estranged due to his wanderings of <a href="dictionary.html#thevoid"><b>the Void</b></a>. 
It was the thoughts of <a href="dictionary.html#melkor"><b>Melkor</b></a> that clashed with the theme instructed by 
<a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> and desiring glory and bringing forth his own creations
by the <a href="dictionary.html#flameimperishable"><b>Flame Imperishable.</b></a> to fill the emptiness of 
<a href="dictionary.html#thevoid"><b>the Void</b></a>, placed him at odds with <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a>. 
It is through this discourse of music that many faltered in their singing around <a href="dictionary.html#melkor"><b>Melkor</b></a> and began 
to alter their song according to his tune. Therefore, the original harmony became that of a “raging storm” until 
<a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> rose from his seat and lifted his left hand and smiled, and a new Theme began.</p>

<!--Second Theme-->
<p><i>The Second Theme:</i> Said to be “like and yet unlike” the Theme before it, the Second Theme gathered with it a new power and beauty. However, 
    the discourse of <a href="dictionary.html#melkor"><b>Melkor</b></a> rose above it, and there was a war of sound more violent than before. It was during the Second Theme 
    that <a href="dictionary.html#melkor"><b>Melkor</b></a> was triumphant, and many of the <a href="dictionary.html#ainur"><b>Ainur</b></a> stopped singing entirely.
    <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> rose from his seat again, his expression stern, he raised his right hand, and another Theme began.</p>

<!--Third Theme-->
<p><i>The Third Theme: </i> Unlike any of the others before it, it began quietly amid the Second Theme and sounded like the rippling of sweet notes, 
softly, as it gained power and depth over time, until the former Theme and this one became one. One was said to be filled with “unmeasurable sorrow”
which was said to give it beauty, the other pompous, and loud, in violent opposition. However, the loudness could not overtake the softness, and the 
latter merely formed the former into its own solemn power. This strife was said to cause the dwelling of <a href="dictionary.html#iluvatar"><b>iluvatar</b></a> 
and <a href="dictionary.html#thevoid"><b>the Void</b></a> to “shake” to which at one point, <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> stood
 and raised both hands, and from deeper than the Abyss, “the Music ceased”.</p>

 <h3>Religious Examples of Ilúvatarism in the Text</h3>
<br>
<p><b>In Tolkien's own words:</b><i>"the High Elves had no 'religion' (or religious practices, rather) for those had been in the hads of the gods, praising and adoring Eru 'the One', Ilúvatar the Father of All on the Mt. of Aman"</i></p>
<p><b>Reference:</b> J.R.R. Tolkien; Humphrey Carpenter, Christopher Tolkien (eds.), The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, Letter 156, (dated 4 November 1954)</p>
<br>
<p><b>The Three Prayers:</b> Religious cermonies in which the Númenóreans worshipped Eru. It is said that three times each year, the King (or Queen) of Númenor would lead his people to the summet of  Meneltarma, where a ritual prayer would be said and fruit would be offered upon the summit. This parralled with three annual celebrations in Númenor, known also as the feasts. Erukyermë (known also as: 'Prayer to Eru') was at the beginning of spring, and was for a good year. Erulaitalë (known also as: 'Praise of Eru') was in the middle of summer at the height of Midsummer, the prayer for a good harvest. Lastly, Eruhantalë (known also as: 'Thanksgiving to Eru') was in the autumn, and the prayer offered thanks to Eru for a good harvest. It is said that only the King was allowed to speak (as they were descended from the Elves and the Maiar through Lúthien) and that Erukyermë marked the beginning of a new year. Thus the Three Prayers are to give praise to the coming of the seasons and to Eru Iluvatar. The king is said to ascend the mountain on foot and followed by a great number of people, all wearing white and garlanded. The Witnesses of Manwë were sacred Eagles of the Valar Manwë and were said to have kept watch upon the great mountain of Meneltarma. They are remain in the sky and hover during the Three Prayers though would not land during the ceremony. Their presence is said to have shown and displayed the approval of Manwë. It is said the Three Prayers were observed "without fail" by the earlier Kings of Númenor but that the first King explicitly said to have abandoned the Prayers altogether was Ar-Gimilzôr, the twenty-third ruler of Númenor. While the origins of the Three Prayers are not known, the Valar often held feasts in celebration before the Darkening of Valinor, and the Númenóreans may have created the Three Prayers in honor of this tradition as they were told by the Ñoldor. The Three Prayers tradition did not survive with the Faithful after the Downfall of Númenor.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Something to note:</b> It is often conveyed within the text that Eru doesn’t seem to care how his Children view him. He delegates everything to Manwë , his second in command. It’s only when Manwë and the other Valar ask for his help in dealing with Númenor that he intervenes, and in a pretty extreme way at that (i.e., completely flooding the island and murdering most the inhabitants). The removed and distant nature of Eru Ilúvatar has capitvated and fascinated many fans of <i>the Silmarillion.</i></p>

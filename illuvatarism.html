  <h1>Ilúvatarism</h1>

  <p><b>Ilúvatarism</b> is the belief and worship of <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> and the heavenly host of the 
  <a href="dictionary.html#valar"><b>Valar</b></a> created underneath him, most notably the <a href="dictionary.html#ainur"><b>Ainur</b></a>,
  and the <a href="dictionary.html#maiar"><b>Maiar</b></a>. Attributes of Ilúvatarism may be the dedication and worship of Eru Ilúvatar, often 
  entailing respect and submission to the Ainur, to which <a href="dictionary.html#ea"><b>Eä</b></a> is divinely dictated underneath them, or simply 
  the belief in the existence of Eru Ilúvatar.</p>
   <br>
    <h2>Music</h2>
<p>Music plays a critical role in the mythos of J.R.R. Tolkien’s legendarium.</p>
<br>
<h3>Creation</h3>
<p>The creation of <b>Eä</b> is accounted in the <i>Ainulindalë</i> and speaks of the “The Great Music” (which translates in the Elvish language of Quenya to mean “Music of the Ainur”). It is through the creative power of music that the entire cosmos is created, and it is said that <b>Eru Ilúvatar</b> made divine music within the <b>Ainur.</b></p>
<p><i>The First Theme: </i> References when <b>Eru Ilúvatar</b> permitted the <b>Ainur</b> to weave their own ideas into the Music—endowed to them by the <b>Flame Imperishable.</b> The Music was said to have filled the <b>Timeless Halls</b> and passed even beyond them into <b>the Void</b>, and so that “it was not the void”. The flawless Music of the <b>Ainur</b> satisfied even <b>Eru Ilúvatar</b>, but discord entered the theme of music on the account of <b>Melkor</b>, an Ainu whose thoughts were different than that of the others, and had become estranged due to his wanderings of <b>the Void</b>. It was the thoughts of <b>Melkor</b> that clashed with the theme instructed by <b>Eru Ilúvatar</b> and desiring glory and bringing forth his own creations by the <b>Flame Imperishable</b> to fill the emptiness of <b>the Void</b>, placed him at odds with <b>Eru Ilúvatar</b>. It is through this discourse of music that many faltered in their singing around <b>Melkor</b> and began to alter their song according to his tune. Therefore, the original harmony became that of a “raging storm” until <b>Eru Ilúvatar</b> rose from his seat and lifted his left hand and smiled, and a new Theme began.</p>
<p><i>The Second Theme:</i> Said to be “like and yet unlike” the Theme before it, the Second Theme gathered with it a new power and beauty. However, the discourse of <b>Melkor</b> rose above it, and there was a war of sound more violent than before. It was during the Second Theme that <b>Melkor</b> was triumphant, and many of the <b>Ainur</b> stopped singing entirely. <b>Eru Ilúvatar </b> rose from his seat again, his expression stern, he raised his right hand, and another Theme began.</p>
<p><i>The Third Theme: </i> Unlike any of the others before it, it began quietly amid the Second Theme and sounded like the rippling of sweet notes, softly, as it gained power and depth over time, until the former Theme and this one became one. One was said to be filled with “unmeasurable sorrow” which was said to give it beauty, the other pompous, and loud, in violent opposition. However, the loudness could not overtake the softness, and the latter merely formed the former into its own solemn power. This strife was said to cause the dwelling of <b>Ilúvatar</b> and <b>the Void</b> to “shake” to which at one point, Eru Ilúvatar stood and raised both hands, and from deeper than the Abyss, “the Music ceased”.</p>

    <h1>Melkorism</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Morgoth, The Dark Lord</h3>
    <p>"And he descended upon Arda in power and majesty greater than any other of the Valar, as a mountain 
      that wades in the sea and has its head above the clouds and is clad in ice and crowned with smoke and fire; 
      and the light of the eyes of Melkor was like a flame that withers with heat and pierces with a deadly cold."</p>
    <p><strong>-J.R.R. Tolkien, The Silmarillion</strong></p>

  <p><a href="dictionary.html#melkorism"><b>Melkorism</b></a> is the perversion away from 
  <a href="dictionary.html#iluvatarism"><b>Ilúvatarism</b></a>, often influenced by a deity of malicious
  intent such as the <a href="dictionary.html#morgoth"><b>Dark Lord Morgoth</b></a> or the 
  <a href="dictionary.html#sauron"><b>Dark Lord Sauron</b></a>. Melkorism may entail the belief,
  worship, or dedication to Morgoth or Sauron or may simply be the lack of belief or the turning away of 
  <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> and the <a href="dictionary.html#valar"><b>Valar</b></a> hosts.</p>

  <h2> Corruption of Melkor </h2>
  <br>
<p> Melkor, known also as <b>Morgoth</b>, was the greatest of the Ainur created by <b>Eru Ilúvatar. </b> He rebelled against <b>Eru Ilúvatar </b> when he disrupted the “Great Music” and lead many of the Ainur against <b>Eru Ilúvatar. </b> Committing many of the evils and atrocities of the <b>First Age,</b>  which lead to him being called <b>Morgoth,</b> such crimes underneath his belt included the theft of the <b>Silmarils</b> and the destruction of the <b>Two Lamps</b> and the <b>Two Trees of Valinor.</b> </p> 
<p><i> The Two Lamps:</i> Known also as <b> Illuin</b> (“sky-blue” in Quenya) and <b>Ormal </b> (“high gold” in Quenya), they were the “Lamps of the Valar” and stood on the southern and northern ends of Arda in the primeval times. When the <b>Valar</b> entered the world, there was said to be a “misty light veiling the barren ground” and that the <b>Valar</b> took this light and fastened it into two lamps. <b>Helcar</b> was the Northern most tower that housed <b>Illuin</b> and <b>Ringil</b> was the Southern most tower that housed <b>Ormal</b>, forged by the <b>Valar Aulë.</b> The <b>Valar Varda</b> filled them with light and the great <b> Valar Manwë</b> hallowed them out—and it was said in the center of <b>Middle Earth</b> where the light of the two lamps met, the vegetation of <b>Yavanna</b> was richer, yet these lamps were destroyed by <b>Melkor</b> and their fall was described as cataclysmic: the weight of the lamps broke continents at their fall and their fire scorched the land, and the original design of the Valar was lost forever—and the <b>Valar</b> not knowing when or where the <b>Children of Eru</b> would come, feared to touch the earth again.</p>
<p><i>The Two Trees of Valinor:</i>  Known also as <b> Telperion</b> and <b>Laurelin,</b> the silver and gold trees that brought light to <b>Valinor</b> (“the Land of the Valar”) after the destruction of the <b>Two Lamps</b> and before the raising of the <b>Moon</b> and <b>Sun.</b> The <b>Valar Yavanna</b> was said to have sung the two trees into existence, <b>Telperion</b> considered to be male and <b>Laurelin</b> said to be female. The trees sat on a hillside called <b>Ezellohar</b> outside of <b>Valinor,</b> and they grew in the presence of the <b>Valar</b> and were watered by the tears of <b>Nienna.</b> Each tree was a source of light, <b>Telperion</b> the silver, and <b>Laurelin</b> the gold. The first count of time began with the first light of <b>Telperion</b> and began the <b>Years of the Trees.</b> However, an envious <b>Melkor</b> darkened <b>Valinor</b> and enlisted the help of a spider of the <b>Void</b> named <b>Ungoliath</b> and concealed under darkness, <b>Melkor</b> struck the trees of <b>Valinor</b> and <b>Ungoliant</b> devoured the light that remained. The last flower of <b>Telperion</b> later became the <b>Moon</b> and the last fruit of <b>Laurelin</b> became the <b>Sun</b> and the last true light of the trees before the poisoning of <b>Ungoliant</b> resided in the <b>Silmarils.</b></p>
<p><i>The Silmarils:</i> Three gems said to be of immense power and beauty, they were crafted by the <b> Ñoldor, Fëanor</b> who was son of the first King of the<b> Ñoldor</b>, <b>Finwë</b> and later succeeded him after the murder of <b>Finwë.</b> <b> Fëanor</b> was said to be a great craftsman and fashioned the <b>Silmarils</b> and in their heart burned the light of <b>Valinor.</b> The exact making of the <b>Silmarils</b> is unknown to all besides <b> Fëanor</b> and none ever succeeded in replicating their beauty. It is said that the <b> Valar, Varda</b> hallowed out the <b>Silmarils</b> so that no mortal or evil hands may touch them without being burned or withered. However, the <b>Silmarils</b> were tainted by the arrogance and lust of those who desired them, starting first with <b>Melkor</b> and then with <b> Fëanor.</b> Following the <b>Doom of Mandos,</b> the <b>Silmarils</b> resulted in evil ends such as the <i>Fall of the Noldor, the Oath of Fëanor, Kinslayings,</i> and <i>the destruction of Doriath.</i> As legend had it, <b> Fëanor</b> wore the <b>Silmarils</b> at festivals for the <b>Eldar</b> to admire them, but when <b>Melkor</b> began to desire them, <b> Fëanor</b> locked them up and became greedy. Following the destruction of the <b>Two Trees,</b> the <b>Valar</b> begged <b> Fëanor</b> to let them use the remaining light of <b>Telperion</b> and <b>Laurelin</b> to recreate them, but he refused. Yet word came still to <b> Fëanor</b> that <b>Melkor</b> murdered his father, the High King <b>Finwë</b> and made off with the <b>Silmarils</b> to the Northern lands of <b>Middle Earth</b> where he fastened them into an iron crown after they marred his hands and <b> Fëanor </b> banished himself and his seven sons in pursuit, swearing he would not rest until the <b>Silmarils</b> were secured. The flight of <b> Fëanor</b> concluded in never ending grief for the <b>Elves</b> and <b>Men</b> of <b>Middle Earth</b> in the <b>First Age.</b></p>

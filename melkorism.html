    <br>
    <h3>Morgoth, The Dark Lord</h3>
    <p>"And he descended upon Arda in power and majesty greater than any other of the Valar, as a mountain 
      that wades in the sea and has its head above the clouds and is clad in ice and crowned with smoke and fire; 
      and the light of the eyes of Melkor was like a flame that withers with heat and pierces with a deadly cold."</p>
    <p><strong>-J.R.R. Tolkien, The Silmarillion</strong></p>
<br>
<!--Intro Paragraph-->
  <p><a href="dictionary.html#melkorism"><b>Melkorism</b></a> is the perversion away from 
  <a href="dictionary.html#iluvatarism"><b>Ilúvatarism</b></a>, often influenced by a deity of malicious
  intent such as the <a href="dictionary.html#morgoth"><b>Dark Lord Morgoth</b></a> or the 
  <a href="dictionary.html#sauron"><b>Dark Lord Sauron</b></a>. Melkorism may entail the belief,
  worship, or dedication to Morgoth or Sauron or may simply be the lack of belief or the turning away of 
  <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> and the <a href="dictionary.html#valar"><b>Valar</b></a> hosts.</p>
  <br>
  <h2> Corruption of Melkor </h2>
  <br>
<!--Corruption of Melkor-->
<p> Melkor, known also as <a href="dictionary.html#morgoth"><b>Morgoth</b></a>, was the greatest of the Ainur created by 
  <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar.</b></a> He rebelled against <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> 
  when he disrupted the “Great Music” and lead many of the Ainur against <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar.</b></a> Committing many 
  of the evils and atrocities of the <a href="dictionary.html#firstage"><b>First Age,</b></a> which lead to him being called 
  <a href="dictionary.html#morgoth"><b>Morgoth,</b></a> such crimes underneath his belt included the theft of the <a href="dictionary.html#silmarils"><b>Silmarils</b></a> 
   and the destruction of the <a href="dictionary.html#twolamps"><b>Two Lamps</b></a> and the 
   <a href="dictionary.html#ttov"><b>Two Trees of Valinor.</b></a> </p>
<br><br>
<!--The Two Lamps--> 
<p><i> The Two Lamps:</i> Known also as <a href="dictionary.html#illuin"><b>Illuin</b></a> (“sky-blue” in Quenya) and <a href="dictionary.html#ormal"><b>Ormal</b></a> 
  (“high gold” in Quenya), they were the “Lamps of the Valar” and stood on the southern and northern ends of Arda in the primeval times. When the 
  <a href="dictionary.html#valar"><b>Valar</b></a> entered the world, there was said to be a “misty light veiling the barren ground” and that the 
  <a href="dictionary.html#valar"><b>Valar</b></a> took this light and fastened it into two lamps. <a href="dictionary.html#helcar"><b>Helcar</b></a>
   was the Northern most tower that housed <a href="dictionary.html#illuin"><b>Illuin</b></a> and <a href="dictionary.html#ringil"><b>Ringil</b></a>
   was the Southern most tower that housed <a href="dictionary.html#ormal"><b>Ormal</b></a>, forged by the <a href="dictionary.html#aule"><b>Valar Aulë.</b></a>
  The <a href="dictionary.html#varda"><b>Valar Varda.</b></a> filled them with light and the great <a href="dictionary.html#manwe"><b>Valar Manwë.</b></a>
  hallowed them out—and it was said in the center of <a href="dictionary.html#middleearth"><b>Middle Earth</b></a> where the light of the two lamps met, 
  the vegetation of <a href="dictionary.html#yavanna"><b>Yavanna</b></a> was richer, yet these lamps were destroyed by <a href="dictionary.html#melkor"><b>Melkor</b></a>
  and their fall was described as cataclysmic: the weight of the lamps broke continents at their fall and their fire scorched the land, and the original design of the
  Valar was lost forever—and the <a href="dictionary.html#valar"><b>Valar</b></a> not knowing when or where the <a href="dictionary.html#childrenoferu"><b>Children of Eru</b></a>
  would come, feared to touch the earth again.</p>
<br>
<!--The two trees of Valinor-->
<p><i>The Two Trees of Valinor:</i>  Known also as <a href="dictionary.html#telperion"><b>Telperion</b></a> and <a href="dictionary.html#laurelin"><b>Laurelin,</b></a>
the silver and gold trees that brought light to <b>Valinor</b> (“the Land of the Valar”) after the destruction of the <a href="dictionary.html#twolamps"><b>Two Lamps</b></a>
and before the raising of the <a href="dictionary.html#moon"><b>Moon</b></a> and <a href="dictionary.html#sun"><b>Sun.</b></a> The 
<a href="dictionary.html#yavanna"><b>Valar Yavanna</b></a> was said to have sung the two trees into existence, <a href="dictionary.html#telperion"><b>Telperion</b></a>
considered to be male and <a href="dictionary.html#laurelin"><b>Laurelin,</b></a> said to be female. The trees sat on a hillside called
<a href="dictionary.html#ezellohar"><b>Ezellohar</b></a> outside of <a href="dictionary.html#valinor"><b>Valinor,</b></a> and they grew in the presence of the 
<a href="dictionary.html#valar"><b>Valar</b></a> and were watered by the tears of <a href="dictionary.html#nienna"><b>Nienna.</b></a> Each tree was a source of light, 
<a href="dictionary.html#telperion"><b>Telperion</b></a> the silver, and <a href="dictionary.html#laurelin"><b>Laurelin</b></a> the gold. The first count of time began
with the first light of <a href="dictionary.html#telperion"><b>Telperion</b></a> and began the <a href="dictionary.html#yott"><b>Years of the Trees.</b></a> However, 
an envious <a href="dictionary.html#melkor"><b>Melkor</b></a> darkened <a href="dictionary.html#valinor"><b>Valinor,</b></a> and enlisted the help of a spider of the 
<a href="dictionary.html#thevoid"><b>Void</b></a> named <a href="dictionary.html#ungoliant"><b>Ungoliant</b></a> and concealed under darkness, 
<a href="dictionary.html#melkor"><b>Melkor</b></a> struck the trees of <a href="dictionary.html#valinor"><b>Valinor,</b></a> and 
<a href="dictionary.html#ungoliant"><b>Ungoliant</b></a> devoured the light that remained. The last flower of <a href="dictionary.html#telperion"><b>Telperion</b></a>
later became the <a href="dictionary.html#moon"><b>Moon</b></a> and the last fruit of <a href="dictionary.html#laurelin"><b>Laurelin,</b></a> became the 
<a href="dictionary.html#sun"><b>Sun.</b></a> and the last true light of the trees before the poisoning of <a href="dictionary.html#ungoliant"><b>Ungoliant</b></a>
resided in the <a href="dictionary.html#silmarils"><b>Silmarils.</b></a></p>
<br>
<!--The Silmarils-->
<p><i>The Silmarils:</i> Three gems said to be of immense power and beauty, they were crafted by the <a href="dictionary.html#noldor"><b> Ñoldor,</b></a>
<a href="dictionary.html#feanor"><b>Fëanor</b></a> who was son of the first King of the <a href="dictionary.html#noldor"><b> Ñoldor,</b></a> 
<a href="dictionary.html#finwe"><b>Finwë</b></a> and later succeeded him after the murder of <a href="dictionary.html#finwe"><b>Finwë.</b></a> 
<a href="dictionary.html#feanor"><b>Fëanor</b></a> was said to be a great craftsman and fashioned the <a href="dictionary.html#silmarils"><b>Silmarils</b></a>
and in their heart burned the light of <a href="dictionary.html#valinor"><b>Valinor.</b></a> The exact making of the <a href="dictionary.html#silmarils"><b>Silmarils</b></a>
is unknown to all besides <a href="dictionary.html#feanor"><b>Fëanor</b></a> and none ever succeeded in replicating their beauty. It is said that the 
<a href="dictionary.html#valar"><b>Valar</b></a>, <a href="dictionary.html#varda"><b>Valar Varda.</b></a> hallowed out the 
<a href="dictionary.html#silmarils"><b>Silmarils</b></a> so that no mortal or evil hands may touch them without being burned or withered.
 However, the <a href="dictionary.html#silmarils"><b>Silmarils</b></a> were tainted by the arrogance and lust of those who desired them, starting first with
<a href="dictionary.html#melkor"><b>Melkor</b></a> and then with <a href="dictionary.html#feanor"><b>Fëanor.</b></a> Following the
<a href="dictionary.html#doomofmandos"><b>Doom of Mandos,</b></a> the <a href="dictionary.html#silmarils"><b>Silmarils</b></a> resulted in evil ends such as the 
<i>Fall of the Noldor, the Oath of Fëanor, Kinslayings,</i> and <i>the destruction of Doriath.</i> As legend had it, <a href="dictionary.html#feanor"><b>Fëanor</b></a>
wore the <a href="dictionary.html#silmarils"><b>Silmarils</b></a> at festivals for the <a href="dictionary.html#eldar"><b>Eldar</b></a> to admire them, but when
<a href="dictionary.html#melkor"><b>Melkor</b></a> began to desire them, <a href="dictionary.html#feanor"><b>Fëanor</b></a> locked them up and became greedy. 
Following the destruction of the <a href="dictionary.html#ttov"><b>Two Trees of Valinor,</b></a> the <a href="dictionary.html#valar"><b>Valar</b></a> begged 
<a href="dictionary.html#feanor"><b>Fëanor</b></a> to let them use the remaining light of <a href="dictionary.html#telperion"><b>Telperion</b></a> and
<a href="dictionary.html#laurelin"><b>Laurelin,</b></a> to recreate them, but he refused. Yet word came still to <a href="dictionary.html#feanor"><b>Fëanor</b></a>
that <a href="dictionary.html#melkor"><b>Melkor</b></a> murdered his father, the High King <a href="dictionary.html#finwe"><b>Finwë</b></a> and made off with the 
<a href="dictionary.html#silmarils"><b>Silmarils</b></a> to the Northern lands of <a href="dictionary.html#middleearth"><b>Middle Earth</b></a> where he fastened 
them into an iron crown after they marred his hands and <a href="dictionary.html#feanor"><b>Fëanor</b></a> banished himself and his seven sons in pursuit, swearing 
he would not rest until the <a href="dictionary.html#silmarils"><b>Silmarils</b></a> were secured. The flight of <a href="dictionary.html#feanor"><b>Fëanor</b></a>
concluded in never ending grief for the <a href="dictionary.html#elves"><b>Elves</b></a> and <a href="dictionary.html#men"><b>Men</b></a> of 
<a href="dictionary.html#middleearth"><b>Middle Earth</b></a> in the <a href="dictionary.html#firstage"><b>First Age.</b></a></p>

    <h1>Melkorism</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Morgoth, The Dark Lord</h3>
    <p>"And he descended upon Arda in power and majesty greater than any other of the Valar, as a mountain that wades in the sea and has its head above the clouds and is clad in ice and crowned with smoke and fire; and the light of the eyes of Melkor was like a flame that withers with heat and pierces with a deadly cold."</p>
    <p><strong>-J.R.R. Tolkien, The Silmarillion</strong></p>

  <p><b>Melkorism</b> is the perversion away from <b>Ilúvatarism</b>, often influenced by a deity of malicious intent such as the <b>Dark Lord Morgoth</b> or the <b>Dark Lord Sauron</b>. Melkorism may entail the belief, worship, or dedication to Morgoth or Sauron or may simply be the lack of belief or the turning away of <b>Eru Ilúvatar</b> and the <b>Valar</b> hosts.</p>

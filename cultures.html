  <h2>The Children of Eru Ilúvatar</h2>
  <p>Also known as <b>Híni Ilúvataro</b> or <b>Eruhíni,</b> the “Children of Eru” are reference to the two races known as <b>Elves</b> and <b>Man.</b> Their existence was conceived in the Music of the <b>Ainur</b> or “The Great Music” but unlike with the creation of Arda, the <b>Valar</b> had no involvement in their birthing, but only <b>Eru Ilúvatar</b> bought them into being. They were said to be endowed with the same <b>fëar</b> or spirit that the <b>Ainur</b> possessed but far lesser in power.</p>
  <p>The Children of Eru were also to possess physical bodies of flesh and sprit, their flesh (or <b> hröar</b>) being as important to them as their <b> fëar.</b> Being embodied souls created by <b>Eru Ilúvatar</b> made <b>Elves</b> and <b>Man</b> extraordinarily different than other races such as <b>the Dwarves</b>, <b>the Hobbits</b>, <b>the Orcs</b>, and <b>the Ents</b> for they were gifted by <b>Eru Ilúvatar</b> and called “the Kindered”. The <b>Elves</b> were gifted with great beauty, nearly immortal lives, skills of craftsmanship, and keen memories, where as <b>Man</b> were bestowed <i>free will</i> to act outside the boundaries of the Music of the <b>Ainur</b> and inevitable supremacy of <b>Middle Earth</b> and perhaps the greatest gift of all: mortality in that of death, and once they die, their <b>fëar</b> goes on to rest with <b>Eru Ilúvatar</b> himself.</p>
  <p><b>Elves</b> were the first of the Children of Eru to be born unto <b>Middle Earth,</b> as <b>Man</b> did not awaken until the Rising of the <b>Sun</b> and the beginning of the <b>First Age</b> nearly thousands of years later. The <b>Elves</b> awoke on an island bay known as <b>Cuiviénen</b> and upon awakening, first saw the stars of <b>Varda</b> that ignited the importance of such <b>Valar</b> unto the <b>Elves.</b> <b>Man</b> woke in <b>Hildórien,</b> a land in the far east of <b>Middle Earth.</b> It is said among the <b>Elves</b> that Morgoth went there to put darkness in the hearts of <b>Man</b> and that some <b>Man</b> where were at war with those under the <b>Shadow</b> fled <b>Hildórien,</b> seeking the light of the <b>West.</b></p>
  <br>
  <h3>The Dwarves & the Hobbits</h3>
  <p>The <b>Dwarves</b> and the <b>Hobbits</b> were not considered to be “Children of Ilúvatar”. Though the <b>Dwarves</b> were the first creations outside the <b>Ainur</b> to be given sapience by <b>Eru Ilúvatar,</b> they were not created by him, but by the <b>Valar Aulë.</b> <b> Aulë</b> did not have the divine power to create life and so <b>Eru</b> ordered him to destroy the <b>Dwarves</b> with his hammer. For the <b>Dwarves</b> were bound to <b> Aulë’s</b> will, and when <b> Aulë</b> lifted his hammer, the <b>Dwarves</b> begged for mercy. <b> Ilúvatar</b> took pity upon the <b>Dwarves</b> and gave them true life in that they would also have a part to play in the role of <b>Arda</b> but given that the <b>Elves</b> were to be the firstborn, <b>Eru</b> told <b>Aulë</b> to lay them to sleep in a chamber underneath a mountain, where they woke after the <i>Awakening of the Elves.</i> The <b>Hobbits</b> are considered then either a variation of <b>Man</b> not bestowed the <b>Gift of Man</b> or a creation of the <b>Valar Yavanna</b> herself, to whom <b> Eru Ilúvatar</b> also took pity upon and gave purpose to them in the Music of the <b>Ainur.</b></p>

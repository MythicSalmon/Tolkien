  <a href="dictionary.html#races"><b>Races</b></a> include the inhabitants of <a href="dictionary.html#ea"><b>Eä</b></a>
  which are but not limited to—the <a href="dictionary.html#dwarves"><b>Dwarves</b></a>, the 
  <a href="dictionary.html#elves"><b>Elves</b></a>, the <a href="dictionary.html#ents"><b>Ents</b></a>, 
  the <a href="dictionary.html#hobbits"><b>Hobbits</b></a>, the <a href="dictionary.html#maiar"><b>Maiar</b></a>, 
  the <a href="dictionary.html#men"><b>Men</b></a>, the <a href="dictionary.html#orcs"><b>Orcs</b></a>,
  the <a href="dictionary.html#spirits"><b>Spirits</b></a>, the <a href="dictionary.html#undead"><b>Undead</b></a>, 
  and the <a href="dictionary.html#valar"><b>Valar</b></a>. The cultures of the inhabitants of Eä are the
  unique expression of beliefs and lifestyles they possess in and of the world around them.

  <h2>The Children of Eru Ilúvatar</h2>
  <p>Also known as Híni Ilúvataro or Eruhíni, the <a href="dictionary.html#childrenoferu"><b>“Children of Eru”</b></a> are reference to the two races known as 
  <a href="dictionary.html#elves"><b>Elves</b></a> and <a href="dictionary.html#men"><b>Man.</b></a> Their existence was conceived in the Music of the
  <a href="dictionary.html#ainur"><b>Ainur</b></a> or “The Great Music” but unlike with the creation of Arda, the <a href="dictionary.html#valar"><b>Valar</b></a>
   had no involvement in their birthing, but only <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> bought them into being. They were said to be endowed
   with the same <a href="dictionary.html#fear"><b>fëar</b></a> or spirit that the <a href="dictionary.html#ainur"><b>Ainur</b></a> possessed but far lesser in power.</p>
  <p>The Children of Eru were also to possess physical bodies of flesh and sprit, their flesh (or <a href="dictionary.html#hroar"><b> hröar</b></a>) being as important to them as their
  <a href="dictionary.html#fear"><b>fëar.</b></a> Being embodied souls created by <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> made
  <a href="dictionary.html#elves"><b>Elves</b></a> and <a href="dictionary.html#men"><b>Man.</b></a> extraordinarily different than other races such as 
  <a href="dictionary.html#dwarves"><b>the Dwarves</b></a>, <b>the Hobbits</b>, <b>the Orcs</b>, and <b>the Ents</b> for they were gifted by <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> and called “the Kindered”. The <a href="dictionary.html#elves"><b>Elves</b></a> were gifted with great beauty, nearly immortal lives, skills of craftsmanship, and keen memories, where as <a href="dictionary.html#men"><b>Man.</b></a> were bestowed <i>free will</i> to act outside the boundaries of the Music of the <a href="dictionary.html#ainur"><b>Ainur</b></a> and inevitable supremacy of <b>Middle Earth</b> and perhaps the greatest gift of all: mortality in that of death, and once they die, their <b>fëar</b> goes on to rest with <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> himself.</p>
  <p><a href="dictionary.html#elves"><b>Elves</b></a> were the first of the Children of Eru to be born unto <b>Middle Earth,</b> as <a href="dictionary.html#men"><b>Man.</b></a> did not awaken until the Rising of the <b>Sun</b> and the beginning of the <b>First Age</b> nearly thousands of years later. The <a href="dictionary.html#elves"><b>Elves</b></a> awoke on an island bay known as <b>Cuiviénen</b> and upon awakening, first saw the stars of <b>Varda</b> that ignited the importance of such <a href="dictionary.html#valar"><b>Valar</b></a> unto the <a href="dictionary.html#elves"><b>Elves.</b></a> <a href="dictionary.html#men"><b>Man.</b></a> woke in <b>Hildórien,</b> a land in the far east of <b>Middle Earth.</b> It is said among the <a href="dictionary.html#elves"><b>Elves</b></a> that Morgoth went there to put darkness in the hearts of <a href="dictionary.html#men"><b>Man.</b></a> and that some <a href="dictionary.html#men"><b>Man.</b></a> where were at war with those under the <b>Shadow</b> fled <b>Hildórien,</b> seeking the light of the <b>West.</b></p>

  <h3>The Dwarves & the Hobbits</h3>
  <p>The <a href="dictionary.html#dwarves"><b>the Dwarves</b></a> and the <a href="dictionary.html#hobbits"><b>Hobbits</b></a> were not considered to be 
  “Children of Ilúvatar”. Though the <a href="dictionary.html#dwarves"><b>the Dwarves</b></a> were the first creations outside the 
  <a href="dictionary.html#ainur"><b>Ainur</b></a> to be given sapience by <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar,</b></a> they were not created by 
  him, but by the <a href="dictionary.html#aule"><b>Valar Aulë.</b></a> Aulë did not have the divine power to create life and so <b>Eru</b> ordered him to destroy the
  <a href="dictionary.html#dwarves"><b>the Dwarves</b></a> with his hammer. For the <a href="dictionary.html#dwarves"><b>the Dwarves</b></a> were bound to 
  <a href="dictionary.html#aule"><b> Aulë’s</b></a> will, and when <b> Aulë</b> lifted his hammer, the <a href="dictionary.html#dwarves"><b>the Dwarves</b></a>
  begged for mercy. <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b> Ilúvatar</b></a> took pity upon the <a href="dictionary.html#dwarves"><b>the Dwarves</b></a>
  and gave them true life in that they would also have a part to play in the role of <b>Arda</b> but given that the <a href="dictionary.html#elves"><b>Elves</b></a>
  were to be the firstborn, <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru</b></a> told <a href="dictionary.html#aule"><b>Aulë</b></a> to lay them to sleep in a chamber
 underneath a mountain, where they woke after the <i>Awakening of the Elves.</i> The <a href="dictionary.html#hobbits"><b>Hobbits</b></a> are considered then either
  a variation of <a href="dictionary.html#men"><b>Man.</b></a> not bestowed the <a href="dictionary.html#giftofman"><b>Gift of Man</b></a> or a creation of the
  <a href="dictionary.html#yavanna"><b>Valar Yavanna</b></a> herself, to whom <a href="dictionary.html#eruiluvatar"><b>Eru Ilúvatar</b></a> also took pity upon 
  and gave purpose to them in the Music of the <a href="dictionary.html#ainur"><b>Ainur.</b></a></b></p>
